# PDF Reader and Chunker App (Flutter)

This is a mobile application developed using **Flutter** that helps users read PDFs and break them into smaller, manageable chunks. The app extracts content from each page of a PDF and splits it into smaller parts, improving the readability of long documents. If needed, it utilizes **Generative AI** to intelligently split or summarize the content.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: View all the PDFs stored on the device, with an option to filter and display only selected PDFs.
- **PDF Viewer**: Open and view PDF documents. Users can select text from the PDF for further interaction.
- **Chunking Feature**: Break a single page of the PDF into smaller, more readable chunks. The content is split intelligently, with the help of generative AI (if required).
- **Search/Filter PDFs**: A search bar or filtering options to make it easier for users to find specific PDFs in their storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development framework used for building the app.
- **Generative AI**: Used for splitting or summarizing the content of PDF pages.
- **Flutter PDF Packages**: Used for rendering and interacting with PDF files on both Android and iOS devices.
